# nand2tetris
This repository is solely for me tracking my progress while I complete the nand2tetris book. I will keep projects that I complete here for later reference when I want to do more with this project.

If you're interested in learning nand2tetris you can pick up the material [here](https://www.nand2tetris.org/) and follow along with the online course.
